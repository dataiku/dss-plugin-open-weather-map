# OpenWeatherMap plugin

This Dataiku DSS plugin provides a way to add weather information to your data. It uses
[openWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with the specific service [One call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

For the moment, only the free version of the API is implemented. It offers **5 days of historical data and 7 days of forecast**,
with hourly and daily granularity.
